# Asian & Lookback Options

This Jupyter Notebook explores the implementation of Monte Carlo simulations for pricing Asian and Lookback options using the Euler-Maruyama method. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to modeling the underlying asset price dynamics and calculating the option payoffs under different averaging techniques.

**Key Topics:**
- Monte Carlo Simulation
- Euler-Maruyama Method
- Asian Options (Fixed and Floating Strike)
- Lookback Options (Fixed and Floating Strike)
- Geometric & Arithmetic Averaging
