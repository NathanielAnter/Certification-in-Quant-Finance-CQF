# Advanced Quantitative Finance Techniques: A Comprehensive Analysis

Welcome to my Certification in Quantitative Finance (CQF) project repository. This repository is a culmination of rigorous work and dedication in applying advanced quantitative techniques to solve complex financial problems. Below is an overview of the key projects included in this repository:

## 1. **Deep Learning for Asset Price Prediction**
   - **Project Description:** This project leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict upward price movements in assets. The project covers the entire pipeline from data collection and preprocessing to model evaluation and backtesting.
   - **Highlights:**
     - **Data Collection & Preprocessing:** Utilized Yahoo Finance and Bloomberg APIs for reliable data acquisition.
     - **Technical Indicators & Financial Ratios:** Implemented diverse indicators to enhance feature selection.
     - **Dimensional Reduction:** Applied techniques such as SOM, UMAP, and K-Means Clustering.
     - **LSTM Model Development:** Focused on hyperparameter optimization for improved model accuracy.
     - **Performance Evaluation:** Utilized TensorBoard for detailed model analysis and backtesting for strategy validation.

## 2. **Portfolio Optimization and Value at Risk (VaR)**
   - **Project Description:** This project delves into portfolio optimization using mean-variance analysis, efficient frontier construction, and calculating Value at Risk (VaR) to assess portfolio risks.
   - **Highlights:**
     - **Optimization Techniques:** Solved optimization problems with constraints to achieve optimal portfolio allocations.
     - **Efficient Frontier Analysis:** Constructed and visualized the efficient frontier to understand risk-return trade-offs.
     - **VaR Calculations:** Implemented both analytical and Monte Carlo methods to compute VaR, and performed backtesting to validate the results.
     - **Risk Management:** Assessed portfolio risks using Expected Shortfall (ES) and conducted scenario analysis.

## 3. **Asian & Lookback Options**
   - **Project Description:** This notebook explores the pricing of exotic options such as Asian and Lookback options using Monte Carlo simulations and the Euler-Maruyama method.
   - **Highlights:**
     - **Monte Carlo Simulations:** Generated numerous asset paths to accurately price path-dependent options.
     - **Euler-Maruyama Method:** Applied this numerical technique to approximate solutions for stochastic differential equations (SDEs).
     - **Geometric & Arithmetic Averaging:** Compared different averaging techniques for pricing Asian options.
     - **Fixed & Floating Strike Options:** Analyzed the implications of using fixed versus floating strike prices in Lookback options.

## 4. **Machine Learning and Linear Regression Analysis**
   - **Project Description:** This notebook implements machine learning techniques, with a particular focus on linear regression, to model and predict financial outcomes.
   - **Highlights:**
     - **Data Preprocessing:** Extensive data cleaning and feature engineering to prepare the dataset.
     - **Linear Regression Implementation:** Detailed analysis of the regression model, including assumptions testing and interpretation.
     - **Model Evaluation:** Employed various metrics to assess model performance, and explored regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.
     - **Extensions:** Discussed possible extensions into more advanced machine learning models.
